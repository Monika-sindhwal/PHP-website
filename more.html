            <h2>Introduction to PHP</h2>
            <p>PHP, short for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a popular open-source scripting language widely used for web development. Originally created in 1994, PHP has evolved to become a powerful tool for building dynamic, data-driven websites and applications. PHP code is executed on the server, with the results sent to the client's browser, making it a crucial part of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).</p>
