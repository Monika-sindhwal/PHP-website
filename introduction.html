        <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) has a rich history, originating as a simple set of tools and evolving into one of the most widely-used server-side scripting languages on the web.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>1.1994 – Origins: PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf, who initially developed it as a simple set of CGI scripts in C. These scripts, called "Personal Home Page Tools," helped him track visits to his online resume. <br>
               2. 1995 – PHP 1.0: After seeing potential in the tool, Lerdorf released PHP 1.0 to the public, allowing web developers to build dynamic applications. <br>
              3.1997 – PHP/FI 2.0: PHP/FI (Forms Interpreter) 2.0 added new features such as support for database integration and the handling of HTML form data, which made it more useful for web development. <br>
                4.1998 – PHP 3.0: Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski joined the project, significantly improving PHP by rewriting its core. This version introduced support for various databases and a more structured syntax, making PHP more versatile. <br>
                5.2000 – PHP 4.0: With the release of PHP 4, PHP got its own scripting engine, Zend Engine, created by Gutmans and Suraski. This version was faster and more stable, supporting complex web applications and growing in popularity for larger projects. <br>
                6.2004 – PHP 5.0: PHP 5 introduced enhanced object-oriented programming (OOP) features, a MySQL extension (MySQLi), and the SimpleXML library. The improved Zend Engine 2 made it even more efficient, and it quickly became popular for developing web applications with modern functionality. <br>
                7.2015 – PHP 7.0: PHP 7 was a game-changer, with significant performance improvements through the Zend Engine 3. It doubled performance compared to PHP 5 and reduced memory usage, making it ideal for large-scale applications. PHP 7 also introduced new operators, scalar type declarations, and more. <br>
                8.2020 – PHP 8.0: Released in late 2020, PHP 8 introduced the JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, which boosts performance, particularly for heavy computational tasks. It also included new features like union types, attributes, and enhanced error handling.</p>

            <h3>Key Features and Benefits:</h3>
            <p>1.Server-Side Execution: PHP code is processed on the server, making it ideal for creating dynamic web pages that interact with databases.
                <br>
                2.Database Support: PHP is compatible with a wide range of databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite), enabling data-driven applications. <br>
                3.Platform Independence: PHP runs on all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, and works with various web servers like Apache and Nginx. <br>
                4.Open Source: PHP is free to use, supported by an active community, and continuously updated.
